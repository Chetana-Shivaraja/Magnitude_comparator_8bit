# Magnitude_comparator_8bit
This project implements a magnitude comparator using Verilog and SystemVerilog with UVM for verification. The UVM testbench was developed in EDA Playground. The physical design flow was completed using open-source EDA tools, including OpenROAD, Klayout, and Yosys. The design compares two binary values for greater, equal, or less than.
